# React-Shopping-Cart
## This project utilizes JavaScript, Strapi, Postman, and HTML. 
### In this shopping cart, you can add items to the cart, delete items from the cart, and re-stock (using an API). 
#### Future improvements: making a user friendly way to delete items from the cart; modifying the re-stock feature so items are not duplicated in the product list.
