# React-Shopping-Cart
## This project utilizes JavaScript, Strapi, Postman, and HTML. 
### In this shopping cart, you can add items to the cart, delete items from the cart, and re-stock (using an API). 
### To Run: Clone the repository; In command prompt, find the project location; Run npm install http-server; Run http-server -c-1; Open your browser and navigate to localhost:8080. 
#### Future improvements: making a user friendly way to delete items from the cart; modifying the re-stock feature so items are not duplicated in the product list.
